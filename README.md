# One Thousand Quizzes 🧠

A fun and interactive quiz game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, allowing users to explore a variety of quiz questions pulled from a public API, track their scores, and select difficulty levels. This project was built to deepen my front-end development skills and now serves as a polished addition to my portfolio.
